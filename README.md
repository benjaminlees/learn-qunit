A quick introduction to QUnit JavaScript Unit Testing.

## What is QUnit?

The *official* description on http://qunitjs.com/ is:

> QUnit is a powerful, easy-to-use JavaScript unit testing framework. 
> It's used by the jQuery, jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile projects and 
> is capable of testing any generic JavaScript code.

Don't be put off by the excessive *purple* on the QUnit home page. ;-)



> There is a good introductory tutorial on the QUnit website:
