A quick introduction to QUnit JavaScript Unit Testing.

## What is QUnit?

The *official* description on http://qunitjs.com/ is:

> QUnit is a powerful, easy-to-use JavaScript unit testing framework. <br />
> It's used by the jQuery, jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile projects and 
> is capable of testing any generic JavaScript code.

## Why Should I Learn (How to Use) QUnit?

My **top three** reasons you should learn QUnit are:

1. QUnit has a ***shallow learning curve***. (*start testing in 5 mins*!)
2. QUnit is ***well established*** and used extensively by JQuery developers.
3. QUnit has a ***great ecosystem*** of utilities! (QMock, TestSwarm & Blanket.js)

If you have ever had to test (and re-test) a web site/app 
(*[ad nauseam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_nauseam)*)
in *several* browsers, this screenshot will look like ***nirvana*** to you:

These are the **Continuous Integration** (CI) Tests for the QUnit *project*.
Each time a comit is saved the entire suite of (*automated*) tests is run  
in *all* modern browsers **autmatically**!
